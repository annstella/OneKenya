   <h1><strong>History:</h1>
    <p>The history of the Pokot tribe is difficult to sketch. Linguistically, they seem to be related to numerous
      peoples who live in the region with ties to both the Nilo-Hamitic peoples who come from the north and to
      Bantu peoples who come from central Africa. For purposes of the Kenyan census Pokot are placed in the Kalenjin
      group, which consists of many diverse groups of people who share Nilo-Hamitic ancestry and history.
      There are two main subgroups among Pokot.</p>

   <h3><strong>Economic Activities</h3>
   <p>About one quarter of Pokot tribal people are cultivators ("corn people"), while the remaining are
    pastoralists ("cow people"). Among both groups,however, wealth is measured by the number of cows one owns.
    Cows are used for barter, exchange, and most significantly as a form of bride wealth. A man is permitted to marry
    more than one woman, as long as he has sufficient number of cows to offer to her family in exchange. This is the primary
    way for wealth and resources to change hands in Pokot society. Cows are rarely slaughtered for meat because they are much
    more valuable alive. They provide milk, butter, and cheese, which provide an important component of Pokot dietary needs.</p>

    <h2><strong>political systems:</h2>
    <p>Pokot society is governed through a series of age-grades. Group membership is determined by the
    age at which one undergoes initiation. For young men this occurs between ages fifteen and twenty, while for young
    women it usually occurs around age twelve at the onset of menarche. After initiation, young people are allowed to
    marry and are permitted to begin participating in local economic activities. Young men and women form close bonds with
    other members of their initiation groups, and these bonds serve for future political ties. When a man or woman reaches
    old age among Pokot, he or she is accorded a certain degree of status and respect. Responsibilities of elders include
    presiding over important community decisions, festivals, and religious ceremonies.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>"Masai" is a name of Hebrew origin, and it means "Gods Work".</p>
      <p>According to their oral history, they originated from the lower Nile valley (Northwest Kenya) and began migrating around the 15th century, arriving in a long trunk of land stretching from what is now northern Kenya to what is now central Tanzania.</p>

        <h3>Political Organization</h3>
         <p>The age system is the most distinctive feature the Maasai society.</p>
         <p>This system features stratified age sets spaced apart by about fifteen years.</p>
         <p>This dual system of accountability entails an indecisive combination of rivalry between adjacent age sets;
           power struggles which create hostility between the young and the old.</p>
         <p> The dual system creates a strained relationship between warriors and elders over herd theft and adultery by
           the warriors.</p>
         <p>Through a display in force and service, the junior warriors graduate to senior warrior status in a ceremony
           known as Eunoto becoming apart of the home-guard and are allowed to start their own families.</p>

          <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
          <img src="image/images.png" alt="people-of-taita">
          <p>The Taita people are a Bantu tribe living in the Taita Hills on Kenya's southwest, <br>
            near the Tanzania border and surrounding plains.<br>
            What is known as the Taita tribe actually consists of three separate but closely-related <br>
            tribes: Wadawida (or Taita), Wasaghala (Sagalla) and Wataveta (Taveta).
            <h3>how the taitas came to settle</h3>
            <p>Historians believe that the Taitas migrated from Central Africa alongside other Bantu tribes, arriving in present day Kenya from the south through Shungwaya before finally settling in the fertile Taita hills. <br>
              The hills provided the Taita with refuge from raids and attacks by the neighboring Maasai tribe.
              <h3>foods and drinks of the taitas</h3>
              <img src="image/food.png" alt="foods">
              <p>The traditional diet of the Taita consisted of bananas, pumpkins, cassava, beans, sweet potatoes, cowpeas, and millet. Occasionally, this diet would be supplemented with game meat hunted from the plains. However, <br>
                once the Taita started growing maize (corn), and after the government restricted hunting, <br>
                ugali and green cooked vegetables, especially became their staple food.</p>

          <h3>why taitas culture are unique</h3>
          <img src="image/skulls.png" alt="sulls">
          <p>One very unique aspect of Taita culture is the respect accorded to the dead. In the past, <br>
            when a person died, they were buried for a period of about one year, at which time their body would be exhumed. <br>
            The skull would be severed from the rest of the body and taken to a sacred cave - their "proper" abode with the ancestors. <br>
            While this is no longer practiced today, the caves where the skulls can still be found are treated as sacred in many parts of Taita.
            <p>taita circumcise their sons age 7 - 11 to prepare them to become a man but due westernisation most of this culture practices are <br>
              fading away are rare practice</p>
              <h3>economic activities of taitas</h3>
              <img src="image/cows.png" alt="cows"> <br>
              Being an agricultural society in a fertile land, most Taitas practice agriculture
              as their main economic activity. Horticultural production has recently become an important <br>
              economic pursuit in the Taita hills. Taitas also rear dairy cattle and produce most of the milk supply for Kenya's Coast Province. They also grow coffee.

             Gemstone mining is primarily done in the drier parts of Taita land, where large deposits of precious stones <br>
             such as ruby, tanzanite and garnet can be found.

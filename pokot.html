          <h1>POKOT</h1>
          <h3>History:</h3>
          <p>Pokot seem to be related to numerous peoples who live in the region with ties to the nilotic speakers and to Bantu people who come from central Africa.</p>
          <p>For purposes of the Kenyan census Pokot are placed in the Kalenjin group, which consists of many diverse groups of people who share Nilo-Hamitic ancestry and history.</p>

        <h3>Economic Activities:</h3>
        <p>Some of them are cultivators ("corn people"), while others are pastoralists ("cow people").</p>
        <p>Among both groups,however,their wealth is directly proportional to the number of cows one owns.</p>
        <p>Cows are used for barter, exchange, and most significantly as bride wealth</p>

          <h3>Political Systems:</h3>
          <p>Pokot society is governed through a series of age-grades.</p>
          <p>Group membership is determined by the age at which one undergoes initiation,for both male and female.</p>
          <p> After initiation, young people are allowed to marry and are permitted to begin participating in local economic activities.</p>
          <p>When one reaches old age among Pokot, he or she is accorded a certain degree of status and respect.</p>
          <p> Responsibilities of elders include;</p>
